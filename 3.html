   Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers.
   There are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions,
   rather than general programming languages. Early ones preceded the invention
   of the digital computer, the first probably being the automatic flute player
   described in the 9th century by the brothers Musa in Baghdad, during the
   Islamic Golden Age.[1] Since the early 1800s, programs have been used to
   direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms, music boxes and player
   pianos.[2] The programs for these machines (such as a player piano's scrolls)
   did not produce different behavior in response to different inputs or
   conditions.
   Thousands of different programming languages have been created, and more are
   being created every year. Many programming languages are written in an
   imperative form (i.e., as a sequence of operations to perform) while other
   languages use the declarative form (i.e. the desired result is specified, not
   how to achieve it).
   The description of a programming language is usually split into the two
   components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning). Some languages are
   defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming language
   is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a
   dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages have both,
   with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the
   dominant implementation being common.
